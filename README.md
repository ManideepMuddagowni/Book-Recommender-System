# Book Recommender System Using Machine Learning | Collaborative Filtering

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **Book Recommender System** utilizing **Collaborative Filtering** to recommend books to users based on their preferences. The system helps users find books they are likely to enjoy, based on the choices of others with similar tastes.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering:** The system analyzes user preferences and recommends books by comparing them to others with similar profiles.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Recommendations are tailored to individual user profiles based on past activities, such as ratings and interactions.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses machine learning algorithms to predict what books a user may enjoy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning algorithms)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManideepMuddagowni/Book-Recommender-System.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the recommender system:
   ```bash
   python recommender.py
   ```

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** The system uses a dataset of book ratings by users.
2. **Model Training:** It trains a collaborative filtering model on the dataset using user ratings.
3. **Recommendation Generation:** Based on the model, it generates personalized book recommendations for each user.

## Example Usage
- After running the script, users are provided with book recommendations based on their ratings and preferences.
